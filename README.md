# Vemo_Rides
This work it's to figure out the performance of the rides requested from a digital  travel platform called VEMO.
The objective of this work it's find the answer for ecah one of the next questions marks:
1)  How many trips are completed each day of the week?
2)  Which hour of the day generates the most revenue?
3)  For the driver ID: 673 determine the mean time between trips (from one trip’s drop_datetime, to the next trip’s request_datetime).
4)  If you had to fire one driver, who would it be? Indicate the Id_driver and the reasons that support your decision.
5)  Do you find any correlation between the parameters in the dataset that have caught
your eye?

Finally summing up all this findings we can assume that, the  balance bewteen travel distance and time for next travel requested are the key drivers that recalibrates the performance of the business.
